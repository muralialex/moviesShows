git clone:

- Creates a local copy of a remote repository (e.g., from GitHub or another server)
- Downloads the entire repository history, including all branches and tags
- Sets up a new Git repository on your local machine
- Establishes a connection between the local and remote repositories

Example: `git clone (link unavailable)

git pull:

- Retrieves new commits from a remote repository (e.g., updates from another developer)
- Downloads and merges the changes into your local repository
- Updates your local branches to match the remote branches
- Requires an existing local repository (created by git clone or other means)

Example: git pull origin main (assuming "origin" is the remote repository and "main" is the branch)

In short:

- git clone initializes a new local repository from a remote source.
- git pull updates an existing local repository with new changes from a remote source.
